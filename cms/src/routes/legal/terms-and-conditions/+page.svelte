    <h2>Description of Services</h2>
    <p>
      The Services include access to the GlycanAge public website including the collection and
      analysis of your blood sample. Unless explicitly stated otherwise, each new feature that
      augments or enhances the current service shall be subject to the Terms and Conditions.
      <br /><br />
      You acknowledge and agree that the Services are provided “AS-IS” and are based on the current state
      of the art of research and technology in use by GlycanAge at the time of the purchase or viewing.
      As research progresses and scientific knowledge and technology evolve, GlycanAge is constantly
      innovating in order to provide the best possible experience for its users. You acknowledge and
      agree that the form and nature of the Services, which GlycanAge provides, may change from time
      to time without prior notice to you. As part of this continuing innovation, you acknowledge and
      agree that GlycanAge may stop (permanently or temporarily) providing some Services (or any features
      within the Services) to you or to users generally at GlycanAge’s sole discretion, without prior
      notice to you. You may stop using the Services at any time. You do not need to specifically inform
      GlycanAge when you stop using the Services unless you are requesting closure of your account or
      withdrawing your consent from the GlycanAge research project. GlycanAge assumes no responsibility
      for the use of Services outside of these Terms and Conditions or other applicable terms.
      <br /><br />
      In order to use the Services, you must obtain Internet access, either directly or through devices
      that access web-based content, and pay any service fees associated with such access. You are solely
      responsible for paying such fees. In addition, you must provide all equipment necessary to make

      space used for the provision of any service, such fixed upper limits may be set by GlycanAge at
      any time, at GlycanAge’s discretion.

    <h2>Risks and Considerations Regarding GlycanAge Services</h2>
    <p>
      Once you obtain your Report information, the knowledge is irrevocable. You should not assume
      that any information we may be able to provide to you, whether now or as research advances,
      will be welcome or positive. You should also understand that as research advances, in order
      for you to assess the meaning of your Report information in the context of such advances, you
      may need to obtain further services from GlycanAge, your doctor or other health care provider.
      <br /><br />
      Feel free to discuss any issue or worry, prior to collecting your sample, with your health care
      practitioner.
      <br /><br />
      Some people feel a little anxious about getting Report information. This is normal. If you feel
      very anxious, you should speak to your doctor or a health professional prior to collecting your
      sample for testing. You may learn information about yourself that you do not anticipate. This information
      may evoke strong emotions and has the potential to alter your life and worldview. You may discover
      things about yourself that trouble you and that you may not have the ability to control or change.
      These outcomes could have social, legal, or economic implications.
      <br /><br />
      The laboratory may not be able to process your sample, and the laboratory process may result in
      errors. The laboratory may not be able to process your sample if your blood sample does not contain
      a sufficient volume or the results from processing do not meet our standards for accuracy. If the
      initial processing fails for any of these reasons, GlycanAge will reprocess the same sample at
      no charge to the user. If the second attempt to process the same sample fails, GlycanAge will offer
      to send another kit to the user to collect a second sample at no charge. If the user declines this
      option, the user is entitled solely and exclusively to a complete refund of the amount paid to
      GlycanAge, less shipping and handling, provided that the user shall not resubmit another sample
      through a future purchase of the service. If the user opts to receive another sample collection
      kit and GlycanAge's attempts to process the second sample are unsuccessful, GlycanAge will not
      send additional sample collection kits and the user will be entitled solely and exclusively to
      a complete refund of the amount paid to GlycanAge, less shipping and handling, provided the user
      shall not resubmit another sample through a future purchase of the service. If the user breaches
      this provision of the agreement and resubmits another sample through a future purchase of the service
      and processing is not successful, GlycanAge will not offer to reprocess the sample or provide the
      user a refund. Even for processing that meets our high standards, a small, unknown fraction of
      the data generated during the laboratory process may be un-interpretable or incorrect. As this
      possibility is known in advance, users are not entitled to refunds where these errors occur.
      <br /><br />
      You should not change your health behaviors solely on the basis of information from GlycanAge.
      Make sure to discuss your Report information with a health care practitioner before you act. In
      either case, if you have concerns or questions about what you learn through GlycanAge, you should
      contact your doctor or other health care provider.
      <br /><br />
      Report information you share with others could be used against your interests. You should be careful
      about sharing your Report information with others. Currently, very few businesses or insurance
      companies request Report information, but this could change in the future. You may want to consult
      a lawyer to understand the extent of legal protection of your Report information before you share
      it with anybody.
      <br /><br />
      Furthermore, Report information that you choose to share with your doctor or other health care
      provider may become part of your medical record and through that route be accessible to other health
      care providers and/or insurance companies in the future. Report information that you share with
      family, friends or employers may be used against your interests. Even if you share Report information
      that has no or limited meaning today, that information could have greater meaning in the future
      as new discoveries are made.
      <br /><br />
      GlycanAge Services are for research, informational, and educational use only. We do not provide
      medical advice. The Report information provided by GlycanAge is for research, informational, and
      educational use only. The Services are not intended to be used by the customer for any diagnostic
      purpose and are not a substitute for professional medical advice. You should always seek the advice
      of your doctor or other health care provider with any questions you may have regarding diagnosis,
      cure, treatment, mitigation, or prevention of any disease or other medical condition or impairment
      or the status of your health.
      <br /><br />
      GlycanAge does not endorse, warrant or guarantee the effectiveness of any specific course of action,
      resources, tests, physician or other health care providers, drugs, biologics, medical devices or
      other products, procedures, opinions, or other information that may be mentioned on our website.
      If we provide to you on our website any recommendations that identify for you, based on your Report
      information and Self-Reported information and scientific literature or research, potentially actionable
      information, this information is intended for informational purposes only and for discussion with
      your doctor or other health care provider. Reliance on any information provided by GlycanAge, GlycanAge
      employees, others appearing on our website at the invitation of GlycanAge, or other visitors to
      our website is solely at your own risk.

    <h2>GlycanAge Privacy Statement and Protection of your Personal Information</h2>
    <p>
      In order to use the Services, you must first acknowledge and agree to our Privacy Statement.
      You may not use the Services if you do not accept the Privacy Statement. You can acknowledge
      and agree to the Privacy Statement by:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Clicking to accept or agree to the Privacy Statement, where GlycanAge makes this option
        available to you for any Services requested; or
      </li>
      <li>Simply by making use of any of our Services.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      If you submit a blood sample to us, we will use that sample solely for the purposes of
      conducting a GlycanAge test and providing you with the Results. The blood sample is
      automatically destroyed once the GlycanAge test has been carried out.
      <br /><br />
      In order to ensure the protection of your privacy, the testing laboratories which we use to conduct
      the GlycanAge test on your blood sample never receive your personal contact details. All tests
      are carried out simply according to the unique identifying number which we give to each of our
      test kits.
      <br /><br />
      When we receive back a Report from the laboratory, we match the unique identifying number back
      to your contact details and send you the Report. We do not share your contact information or the
      details of your Report with any other person (apart from your chosen Specialist Consultants who
      will advise you on the findings of that Report). We will also send to your chosen Specialist Consultants
      the answers you have given to our Health Profile Questionnaire (if you choose to complete this
      optional questionnaire).
      <br /><br />
      Following the receipt of your Report, you are invited to speak with one of our Specialist Consultants
      via a zoom meeting or email/chat link. GlycanAge is not party to any discussions you may have with
      our Specialist Consultants and we have no access to the third-party meeting platform used for those
      discussions. Following your conversation with a Specialist, the Specialist will prepare a summary
      of your discussion (“Consultation Summary”) and send it to your user dashboard. Your Consultation
      Summary will also be sent to other Specialist Consultants who you wish to engage through the platform,
      unless you choose to make the Consultation Summary private (which you can do through your user
      dashboard). Although it is possible for certain specific GlycanAge staff members to access the
      Consultation Summary, those staff members have entered into strict confidentiality terms to protect
      your privacy. Our Specialists Consultants are independent consultants who are contracted by us
      to provide these services, but they are not employees or agents of GlycanAge.
      <br /><br />
      Under our agreements with these Specialist Consultants, we require them to store all personal details
      and information received from you (“Consultation Information”) securely and in full compliance
      with the Data Protection laws. For further details on how your personal information is collected,
      stored and used, please see our Privacy Policy.
      <br /><br />
      You acknowledge and agree that GlycanAge has the right to monitor any use of its systems by its
      personnel at any time and maintain copies documenting such monitoring. Our Privacy Statement sets
      forth the only expectations of privacy any individual should have in terms of usage of the GlycanAge
      Services, website, or other systems. If you have given consent for your Report information and
      Self-Reported information to be used in GlycanAge research as described in the applicable Informed
      Consent Form, we may include your information in the aggregated Report information and Self-Reported
      information we disclose to third parties for the purpose of publication in a peer-reviewed scientific
      journal. GlycanAge may also include your information in aggregated Report information and Self-Reported
      Information disclosed to third-party non-profit and/or commercial research partners who will not
      publish that information in a peer-reviewed scientific journal. GlycanAge research may be sponsored
      by, conducted on behalf of, or in collaboration with third parties, such as non-profit foundations,
      academic institutions or pharmaceutical companies. GlycanAge research may study a specific group
      or population, identify potential areas or targets for therapeutics development, conduct or support
      the development of drugs, diagnostics or devices to diagnose, predict or treat medical or other
      health conditions, work with public, private and/or non-profit entities on Glycomics research initiatives,
      or otherwise create, commercialize, and apply this new knowledge to improve health care. GlycanAge
      will never release your individual-level Report information and/or Self-Reported Information to
      any third party without asking for and receiving your explicit consent to do so unless required
      by law.
      <br /><br />
      Further, you acknowledge and agree that GlycanAge is free to preserve and disclose any and all
      personal information to law enforcement agencies or others if required to do so by law or in the
      good faith belief that such preservation or disclosure is reasonably necessary to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Comply with legal process (such as a judicial proceeding, court order, or government
        inquiry) or obligations that GlycanAge may owe pursuant to ethical and other professional
        rules, laws, and regulations;
      </li>
      <li>Enforce the GlycanAge Terms and Conditions;</li>
      <li>Respond to claims that any content violates the rights of third parties; or</li>
      <li>
        Protect the rights, property, or personal safety of GlycanAge, its employees, its users, its
        clients, and the public.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      In such an event we will notify you through the contact information you have provided to us in
      advance unless doing so would violate the law or court order. You understand that the
      technical processing and transmission of the Services, including your personal information,
      may involve
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Transmissions over various networks; and</li>
      <li>
        Changes to conform and adapt to technical requirements of connecting networks, or devices.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Finally, GlycanAge may, in its sole discretion, restrict access to the website for any reason.
