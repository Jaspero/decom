# Frontend Template

The intent of this template is to provide a starting point for different applications within the GlycanAge ecosystem.

## Getting Started

You need to change the following before using the template on another application:

- Firebase (`/firebase.json`, `.firebaserc`, `.github/workflow/deploy.yml` and `.github/workflow/deploy.dev.yml`) is configured for a `template` web application which doesn't exist. This needs to be changed to real values.
- A `FIREBASE_TOKEN` needs to be added to github secrets.
